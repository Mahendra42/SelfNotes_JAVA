what is REST -- Representational state transfer.

	- state -- data
	- Representation means format -- xml,,json,yaml,html etc.
	- Transfer carrying data between consumer and provider using HTTP protocol.
- Rest is not an architecture but it is a set of constraints that creates a architextural style.which can be used for building ditributed applications.
** Rest allows components to access and manage functions within another application.

Some guidelines needs to be referred for implementing Restful(Rest architecture constraints).
1.Client-server.
2.Stateless
3.Cacheable
4.Uniform interface
5.layered system
6.code on demand.

REST API -- uses http request to GET,PUT,POST and DELETE data following the rest standards.
-Rest api is a set of remote calls using standard methods to return data in specific format.

-Resource -- it is anything that is addressable over the web.which means the resource that can be accessed and transferred between client and server.
	eg: a search result for a particular item in a web index such as google.
	- The most popular representations of resources are xml and json.

-URI -- uniform resource identifier :it is used to identify a resource over a web 
	    - it is like a hyperlink to a resource.

- Representation -- it is a temporal state of an actual data located in a storage device at the time of request.
	   -  different representation forms are images,text files,xml and json.

HTTP methods :
	- GET-- it is used to retrieve the resource information only.
	- POST -- it is used for creating a new resource.
	- PUT -- primarily used to update the existing resource.
	-DELETE -- to delete a resource.
	-PATCH - for partial updation.
HTTP status codes: for every request the server returns a status code indicating the processing status of the request.
 1xx : Information
2xx : Success -- this indicated that client request was accepted successfully
	200 :ok
	201 :created
	202:accepted
	204 : no content

3xx : Redirect : it means client has to take some additional actions to complete their requests.
4xx :Client error : point side error 
	400 : bad request
	401 : unauthorised
	403 : forbidden 
	404 : not found

5xx : server error
	500 : internal server error.
	501 : not implemented
	502: bad gateway
	503 : service unavailable
	504 : gateway Time out.
